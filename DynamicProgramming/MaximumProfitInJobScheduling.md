Defining the dp array is key here. A 1D array where dp[i] gives the max profit for jobs 0 to i - 1. To start off, sort the arrays according to the endTime since we are considering when the job is ending. For the base case, dp[0] = 0 since for 0 jobs the profit is also 0. Start the loop with 1st index, firstly initialise the current dp[i] = dp[i - 1] which indicates skipping the current job. Now find the index of the job whose endTime is less than equal to the startTime of the current job. This gives the last non overapping job. Now add the dp[j + 1] to current profit and check max of this and current value, dp[i]= Math.max(dp[i], dp[j + 1] + jobs[i].profit). Finally return the last cell value of the dp array which has the max profit.
Time complexity: O(NlogN)
Space complexity: O(N)
